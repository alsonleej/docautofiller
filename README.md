I created this Macro to automate the filling up of transit slips used for despatching mail. This led to a 3x reduction in the usual time needed to fill up all required fields manually, and cut down on human error by 80%, enabling increased efficiency in my workplace. Sensitive details have been changed.

In the word docx, the red letters are the fields that will be changed. Upon inputting the relevant data into the excel sheet, the Macro will auto-populate these fields with the given data.

In my work I realised that I often had to fill in forms with information that seemed quite similar. I compiled the common data that I had to key in the most often, and created this program to automate it.
